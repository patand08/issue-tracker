Next.js issue tracker

Decided not to host it on vercel since I'm not willing to subscribe to an online database or expose google API (since it's not an exposed google OAuth, no one would be allowed to login, so makes no sense to me, but feel free to test it by yourself)

Used:

- Next.js
- Tailwind
- Radix UI\*
- React SimpleMDE
- React Hook Form
- Axios
- Prisma + MySQL
- Recharts
- and more

\*(note that Radix and Next above version 13 has a problem with the imports of css files, therefore, the font is the default one for Radix and not Inter. I don't want to fix that)
